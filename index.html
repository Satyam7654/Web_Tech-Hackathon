            <div class="img"></div>
            <h5>Common Cold</h5>
            The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, primarily affecting the nose and
            throat. Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sneezing, and sore throat. It's usually mild and resolves
            within a week.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="img1"></div>
            <h5>Sneezing</h5>
            Sneezing is a natural reflex that helps clear the nose of irritants like dust, pollen, or microbes. It’s
            usually harmless but can be a sign of allergies, infections, or other respiratory issues. Covering your
            mouth and nose is important to prevent spreading germs.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="img2"></div>
            <h5>Flu</h5>
            The flu, or influenza, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses. It often leads to symptoms
            like fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue. Vaccination, good hygiene, and rest are key to
            prevention and recovery.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="img3"></div>
            <h5>Fever</h5>
            Fever is a common symptom indicating the body’s response to an infection or illness. It’s the immune
            system's way of fighting off pathogens. Typically, rest, hydration, and monitoring are essential, but
            persistent high fever may need medical attention.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="img4"></div>
            <h5>Dizziness</h5>
            Dizziness is a sensation of lightheadedness or unsteadiness, often accompanied by a feeling of spinning or
            fainting. It can be caused by dehydration, low blood pressure, inner ear issues, or other underlying health
            conditions.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="img5"></div>
            <h5>Rashes</h5>
            Rashes can appear due to various causes, including allergies, infections, or skin irritants. They often
            present as red, itchy patches on the skin. It's essential to identify the underlying cause for proper
            treatment. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist.

                <b>A Tribute to a Courageous Doctor : </b>

                While doctors around the world work tirelessly to save lives and provide care, their own safety and
                well-being are often overlooked. In particular, one tragic incident stands as a stark reminder of the
                vulnerabilities faced by female doctors. A dedicated doctor, who had devoted her career to the health
                and welfare of her patients, was subjected to a brutal violation while on duty. This heinous act not
                only represents a profound personal tragedy but also underscores a societal failure to protect those who
                selflessly serve us.

                This doctor’s courage in continuing her mission despite such trauma is a testament to her strength and
                resilience. Her experience is a call to action for us all, highlighting the urgent need for systemic
                changes to ensure the safety of our healthcare providers. No doctor should have to fear for their life
                or dignity while performing their duty.

                We must honor her bravery by advocating for stricter safety measures and fostering a culture of respect
                and protection for our medical professionals. This tribute is not just to her, but to all who face risks
                in their line of work. Let us commit to creating a safer, more supportive environment for those who
                dedicate their lives to caring for others.</p>
